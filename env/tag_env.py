"""
env/tag_env.py — Custom Gymnasium environments for the multi-agent tag game.

Architecture: two separate Gymnasium envs (TaggerEnv, RunnerEnv) that each wrap
a shared GridState object. SB3 drives one env at a time; the frozen opponent's
action is computed inside step() so SB3 only sees a standard single-agent MDP.

--- Report-relevant design decisions ---

1. Two-env / shared-state architecture
   Each env is a standard Gymnasium env, so SB3 can plug in without modification.
   The GridState object holds ground-truth positions and is owned by the env that
   is currently being trained; the other env re-uses that same object during eval.
   This avoids synchronisation bugs that arise when two separate envs would drift.

2. Flat observation vector (MlpPolicy, not CNN)
   We encode all task-relevant information explicitly:
     Tagger (15-dim): [own_row_n, own_col_n, lk_opp_row_n, lk_opp_col_n, own_dr, own_dc,
      can_move_up, can_move_down, can_move_left, can_move_right,
      can_move_ul, can_move_ur, can_move_dl, can_move_dr, opp_visible]
     Runner (11-dim): [own_row_n, own_col_n, lk_opp_row_n, lk_opp_col_n, own_dr, own_dc,
      can_move_up, can_move_down, can_move_left, can_move_right, opp_visible]
   A CNN over raw 12×12 pixels would need many more samples to learn positional
   features from scratch, and the grid is small enough that explicit coordinates
   are unambiguous. Flat vector → MlpPolicy → faster training convergence.
   Movement flags directly encode whether a cardinal action would be blocked by a wall,
   so the agent learns navigation constraints without trial-and-error wall collisions.

3. Partial observability via line-of-sight (LOS) occlusion with last-known position
   If a wall cell lies on the ray between the two agents, the opponent's *current*
   position is not known. The observation reports the last-known opponent position
   (the most recent step where LOS was clear) plus an explicit binary `opp_visible`
   flag (1.0 = currently visible, 0.0 = using stale last-known position). Before the
   opponent is ever seen, the last-known position is −1 (a sentinel for "never seen").
   This gives the policy a principled search target when the opponent hides, rather
   than a useless −1 that conveys no spatial information. The explicit visibility flag
   lets the policy learn to distinguish "I see them now" from "I last saw them there".
   LOS is computed with Bresenham's line algorithm using integer arithmetic —
   conservative on diagonal corner touches.

4. Velocity (last displacement) in observation
   own_dr, own_dc ∈ {−1, 0, 1} encode the direction the agent moved last step.
   This gives the policy a one-step momentum signal without requiring recurrence.
   Without it, the policy cannot distinguish "I'm moving towards the opponent"
   from "I just bounced off a wall and am now stationary".

5. Reward design — shaped rewards for both agents for dense learning signals
   Tagger: +15 on catch, −0.1/step time penalty, plus three shaping components:
     (a) Potential-based distance shaping: F = γ·Φ(s') − Φ(s), Φ(s) = −dist.
         Provides a dense gradient toward the runner each step without altering
         the optimal policy (Ng et al., 1999). Weight 0.3 (reduced from 0.5)
         because Manhattan distance ignores walls; too high a weight pulls the
         tagger through walls and produces a misleading gradient.
     (b) STAY action penalty (−0.5): breaks standstill equilibria where the
         tagger avoids negative expected reward by doing nothing.
     (c) Revisit penalty (−0.2): penalises returning to a recently-visited cell,
         breaking 2-step loop traps common in early self-play training.
   Runner: +1/step (survival), −15 on catch, plus two shaping components:
     (a) Potential-based escape shaping: F = γ·dist_after − dist_before.
         Mirror of the tagger's shaping — dense gradient to maximise distance
         from the tagger each step without altering the optimal policy.
     (b) STAY action penalty (−0.1): discourages standing still when the tagger
         approaches, which is the dominant failure mode without this signal.
   Terminal reward ratio: at MAX_STEPS=200, total survival reward ≈ 200.
   Catch bonus (+15) / penalty (−15) ≈ 15 steps' worth — large enough to be
   decisive but not so large that it swamps the per-step shaping signal.

6. Simultaneous movement
   Both agents move at the same time each step. Sequential movement would give a
   first-mover advantage (the first-moving agent sees the updated position of the
   other and can react). Simultaneous movement is fairer and closer to real pursuit.
